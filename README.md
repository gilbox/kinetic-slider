**Note:** **This project is no longer being maintained**. If you're interested in this project, you should really look at my fork  [infinite-slider](https://github.com/gilbox/infinite-slider). It has many more features and has undergone significant QA testing.

#How do I add this to my project?

You can download this by:

* Using bower and running `bower install kinetic-slider`
* Downloading [the zip file](https://github.com/gilbox/kinetic-slider/archive/master.zip)


#Dependencies

kinetic-slider depends on Angular, [angular-mousewheel](https://github.com/monospaced/angular-mousewheel), and [hamsterjs](https://github.com/monospaced/hamster.js).


# Getting Started

You need the following script tags:

````html
<script src="vendor/hamster.js"></script>
<script src="vendor/mousewheel.js"></script>
<script src="gilbox-kinetic-slider.js"></script>
````

Add kinetic-slider as a dependency to your app:

````javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['gilbox.kineticSlider']);
````

Note that in your HTML you may optionally provide the content-width,
otherwise it will be calculated automatically as shown here:

````html
  <div kinetic-slider class="kinetic-slider-container">
    <div class="kinetic-slider-content">

      <!-- content goes here -->

    </div>
  </div>
````

Some minimal styling is required:

````css
.kinetic-slider-container {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.kinetic-slider-content {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;         // note: make sure you set a z-index
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
}
````
